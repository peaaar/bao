# Welcome to Bay Archery Organization

On September 29th, 2024, we hosted our first second-hand equipment market at Palomo Archery. Two weeks before the event, we started making Instagram posts and stories to promote it. During this time, we also created an equipment spreadsheet for archers to list what equipment they would be selling. This also allowed others to see what would be avaliable. During the event, we had around 30 people who attended and lots of purchases made!
